4. **Anticipate Student Needs**: Address common questions and confusions
5. **Enable Immediate Application**: Actionable implementation guidance
6. **Ensure Current Relevance**: Modern examples and future implications

### Content Generation Process

```typescript
const generateAINotes = async (lesson: LessonData) => {
  // Ultra-detailed prompt with comprehensive requirements
  const notesPrompt = `[Extensive prompt with specific academic requirements]`;
  
  // Generate content using Gemini AI
  const notesContent = await geminiService.generateText(notesPrompt);
  
  // Store and persist for future access
  setGeneratedContent(prev => ({...}));
  localStorage.setItem(`ai-content-${courseId}-${lesson.id}`, ...);
};
```
