## ï¿½ðŸ”§ Memory Aids Fix Details

### Issue Identified

The memory aids (mnemonics) block was not displaying properly due to:

- Missing fallback logic when AI generation fails
- Insufficient error handling for empty arrays
- Lack of default content when API doesn't return mnemonics

### Solution Implemented

```typescript
// Added fallback validation in aiNotesService.ts
if (validatedNotes.mnemonics.length === 0) {
  validatedNotes.mnemonics = this.generateDefaultMnemonics(title, description);
}

// Enhanced rendering in ImprovedCourseLearning.tsx
{
  notes.mnemonics && notes.mnemonics.length > 0 && (
    <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
      {/* Enhanced styling and presentation */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Improvements Made

1. **Fallback Logic**: Added `generateDefaultMnemonics()` method
2. **Enhanced Validation**: Better null/undefined checking
3. **Improved Styling**: Professional card design with green accents
4. **Debug Support**: Development mode debugging information
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of generation failures

### Memory Aids Features
